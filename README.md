# description
this is a small school project i had a lot of fun making. i hope it will give you joy as well.
this is a command line based game, you can compile it yourself and play it!
your task is to collect all points (#) before the bear eats you.
# please note
it wasn't tested for macOS or Linux so currently and probably for the end of time it will be only windows :(
# free to use
if you want to take the code you are welcome to! it is free to use for all perpuses (just for fun of course (: )
# contect me
